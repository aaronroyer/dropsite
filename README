dropsite
    gem install dropsite

Dropsite creates a site of interlinked file index pages in the Public directory
of your Dropbox. The site created is minimally invasive to your Public
directory by only creating one top-level HTML page and one folder, leaving your
directories unjunked.

BE WARNED: while this seems to work fine, it is presently considered
experimental.

To create the site:
    $ dropsite

This deletes "index.html" and the directory "dropsite" in your Dropbox Public
directory if they exist, creates "index.html" as the top-level index, and puts
the rest of the index pages and assets in the "dropsite" directory.

To specify a different Dropbox directory:
    $ dropsite --dropbox-home ~/Somewhere/Else

You can also use this if you just want to test this elsewhere before turning
it loose on your precious files.
